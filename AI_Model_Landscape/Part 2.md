# Deep Dive into Gen AI & Large Language Models (Part 2)

**In this part we will see **Lifecycle of LLM** 
But before that we will Dive into Foundational Concepts.

## A **"Model** in Machine Learning
- A mathematical representation that has learned patterns from on new or unseen data without human intervention.
- This representation can be used to make either predictions, classifications, or decisions, based on the algorithm that was selected for the problem at hand.
